# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App! ☀️ This project was created to learn about asynchronous JavaScript using async-await and DOM manipulation.

## Overview

This Weather App displays the temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, and wind speed of a searched city. If the entered value is undefined or the city is not found, it will display "City not found."

## Features

- **Temperature Display:** Shows the current temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity Percentage:** Displays the humidity percentage of the searched city.
- **Wind Speed:** Provides information about the wind speed.
- **Error Handling:** If the city is not found, it shows "City not found."

## Learning Focus

In building this project, I focused on:
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Utilized async-await for fetching weather data.
- DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updated the UI based on the fetched data.
- Error Handling: Displayed a user-friendly message for undefined or not found cities.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Use

1. Enter the city you want to check the weather for.
2. Click the "Search" button.
3. View the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. If the city is not found, "City not found" will be displayed.
